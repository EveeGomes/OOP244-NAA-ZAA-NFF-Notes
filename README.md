## Workshop Zero
As a student in my class, you are to start your semester by familiarizing yourself with GitHub so you can share your daily work with me for advice/help, collaboration and monitoring your progress. 

This is done using what I call Workshop Zero; through a series of videos instructing you on how to set up your computer to use GitHub effectively for collaboration.
 
We will start this together in the first class (make sure you attend) but the detailed instructions of the workshop will be announced shortly.

## 144/100 Review Session  for 244/200 Students
