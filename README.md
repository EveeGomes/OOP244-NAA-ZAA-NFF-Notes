# OOP244 NAA ZAA and NFF Notes

## Workshop Zero
As a student in my class, you are to start your semester by familiarizing yourself with Github so you can share your daily work with me for advice and collaboration. This is done using what I call Workshop Zero; through a series of videos instructing you on how to set up your computer.<br/>
The details of the workshop will be announced shortly. 

## 144/100 Review Session  for 244/200 Students
The review session on IPC144/BTP100 will be held on Monday May 16th at 10:00AM. <br />
This session will be open to all the students who needed to review the 144/100 concepts before starting 244/200 subjects.<br />

Use a microphone, use your real name (the one on your student card) and click [HERE]() to join the session.
